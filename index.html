        <h2>Study Result</h2>
        <p>We have conducted a survey on students and teachers effetive replies are received.</p>
        <p>According to the results, 48.7% of the respondents thinks that online lesson or meeting will affect working or school. While 33.3% agreed on the fact that and 15.4% was very agreed it.</p>
        <p>This survey results reflected covid is brought a lot of trouble for the people such as the effect of working and studying.</p>
        <p>To further understand the impact of COVID 19, we carried out secondary reserach on students.</p>
        <p>With references to our research results, such changes actually affected peoples in different ways.</p>
        <p>For example, students and teachers need to spend a lot of time to online lesson . According to the results, 52.6% of the respondents need to spend about 6 to 8 hours to online lessons on everyday and 11.5% of the respondents need to spend about 8 to 10 hours to online lesson. </p>
        <p>That will make them become unhealthy because they need to spend much time sitting on the computer or tablet with their eyes on the monitor. It will make their eyes become tired easily. And they will have myopia easily too.  </p>
        <p>Also, they will become more fatter when they have online lessons. Because in face to face , students have time to do sports . But during Covid , they have not much times to do sports and become lazy. </p>
        <p>Also, There have some factors to affect students's online lessons. According to the result, 41% of the respondents thinks that network stability is affected them. And 60% of the respondents thinks that classroom interaction is affected them. </p>
        <p>Because when students have online lessons , teachers can not track their happening. Therefore, students will become lazy at that moment. They will go to sleep or do another action which is not link to the lessons.</p>
        <p>At last, students have some difficulty of online learing. According to the result, 47.4% of the respondents think that the lack of self-discipline make them have difficulty of online learing.</p>
        <p>And 41% think that lack of classroom atmosphere, resulting in decreased desire to learn. 42% think that diminished concentration due to environmental distractions. And 37.3% think that lack of interaction with teachers and classmates </p>
        <p>Therefore, those factors are make the students can not foucs on the online learing.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>After summing up all of the discoveries, we came to a conclusion that COVID 19 highly affected the teaching quality.</p>
        <p>This is a urgent problem, changes needed to be made and more people should be concerned about it.</p>
        <p>Although we don't have a lot of say in this world-wide matter, we would like to raise the concern of fellow citizens on 
           the impact brought by COVID 19.</p>

        <h2>Suggestions</h2>
        <p>Not only do we wanted to raise the concern of people on COVID 19, we do also want to express our stance and opnions on it.</p>
        <p>Regarding myopia, we suggest teachers can make the lessons times becomes shorter or have the break time So that students's eyes will not be tired when they have lessons.</p>
        <p>Regarding interaction, we suggest that students need to set the camera when they have online lessons so that teachers can tracking them and teachers can ask more questions to encourage students to answer.</p>
